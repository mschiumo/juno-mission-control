# Goal: w1771737693847 - n8n Integration with OpenClaw

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Description
Research n8n integration with OpenClaw and document implementation steps for workflow automation.

## Action Items
- [x] **ai-1771737727130**: Research n8n integration with OpenClaw and document implementation steps
  - Completed: 2026-02-24
  - Results: See w1771737693847_notes.md for detailed implementation guide

## Research Summary

### Key Findings:

**What is n8n:**
- Open-source, self-hostable workflow automation platform with 400+ integrations
- Visual node-based editor for building complex workflows
- Can be self-hosted (free) or cloud-hosted (paid)
- Fair-code license (source-available)

**Integration Methods:**
1. **OpenClaw → n8n**: HTTP POST to n8n webhooks from OpenClaw agents
2. **n8n → OpenClaw**: HTTP Request nodes call OpenClaw Gateway API
3. **Hybrid**: Bidirectional communication for complex orchestration

**Use Cases for OpenClaw:**
- Trading alerts with multi-channel distribution
- Content automation pipelines (RSS → AI → Social)
- Agent coordination and heartbeat monitoring
- Scheduled reporting and data aggregation
- Webhook-based real-time triggers

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Self-hosted n8n** via Docker (recommended)
2. **Webhook triggers** for OpenClaw-initiated workflows
3. **HTTP Request nodes** for n8n-initiated OpenClaw actions
4. **Optional PostgreSQL** for production deployments

### Comparison vs Cron:
| Feature | Cron | n8n |
|---------|------|-----|
| Visual Monitoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Error Handling | Manual | Built-in retries |
| Debugging | Console logs | Visual step-through |
| Integrations | Custom code | 400+ pre-built |
| Webhooks | Needs server | Built-in |

**Recommendation:** Keep simple cron jobs, migrate complex workflows to n8n
