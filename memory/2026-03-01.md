## Daily Habit Record API Fix (Mar 1, 2026)

### Problem
Cron job "Daily Habit Record - 11:59 PM EST" was failing with HTTP 404.
The `/api/habits/daily-record` endpoint didn't exist.

### Solution
Created the missing API endpoint:
- **File:** `app/api/habits/daily-record/route.ts`
- **POST:** Records daily habit completions to Redis
- **GET:** Retrieves specific date or recent history (365 days)
- **Commit:** `2d7f602`
- **Branch:** `feature/mobile-responsive`

### Mobile Responsive Work (Continued)
**Branch:** `feature/mobile-responsive`

**Components Fixed:**
1. **CalendarView** (`9897c79`) — Card-based trades table on mobile
2. **PositionCalculator** — Touch-friendly inputs, stacked grids
3. **ProfitProjectionView** (`f71505e`) — Stacked inputs, card trade breakdown
4. **AnalyticsView** (`bb652e1`) — Responsive stats, mobile day-of-week

**All high-priority trading components now mobile-friendly.**

### Token Usage

### Cron Issues
- Several crons can't deliver to "MJ" (not a configured Telegram contact)
- Need to update configs to use Telegram ID `8080305413`
