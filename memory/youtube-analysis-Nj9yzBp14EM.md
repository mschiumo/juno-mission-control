## 🔑 The 5-Step Playbook

### Step 1: Learn the Foundations
- Understanding what AI agents can and cannot do
- No-code/low-code platform basics
- Core automation concepts

### Step 2: Identify High-ROI Opportunities
- Finding processes that are:
  - Repetitive
  - Time-consuming
  - Error-prone
  - High volume
- Prioritizing use cases by business impact

### Step 3: Map Out the Entire Process
