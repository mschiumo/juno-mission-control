# 2026-02-23 — Evening Session

## User Feedback & Accountability

MJ called out major inconsistencies in my work:

### Problems Identified
1. **Not verifying before claiming "fixed"** — TypeScript build failed after I said it was fixed
2. **Inconsistent Activity Log logging** — Had to be reminded to log PRs #145-147 and the build fix
3. **Daily processes unreliable** — crons timing out, not running as scheduled

### Specific Issues to Fix
1. **Daily Crons vs Daily Reports misalignment** — Timeouts, not running as scheduled
2. **Daily Motivational Quote** — Not changing daily (still showing same quote)
3. **Weekly Habit Review** — Showing errors
4. **Calendar → Journal navigation** — "Open Journal" button not working when clicking calendar date

### Commits Made
- Fixed TypeScript error in EveningCheckinModal.tsx line 235: `'data?.history?.length' is possibly 'undefined'` → `(data?.history?.length || 0) > 0`
- Pushed to main (commit 169df69)

### Root Cause
Need to verify before claiming done:
- Run local builds before pushing
- Confirm Vercel builds pass before saying "fixed"
- Actually check Activity Log entries went through
- Test features manually before marking complete

## Late Evening Work (11:30 PM EST)

### Gmail OAuth Authentication Feature
- **Spawned subagent** to build Gmail auth feature
- **PR #148 created**: https://github.com/mschiumo/juno-mission-control/pull/148
- Features: NextAuth.js v5, Google OAuth, protected routes, login page, user menu
- Status: Ready for review, requires Google Cloud OAuth credentials

### Outstanding Issues (Still To Fix)
1. **Weekly Habit Review** - Shows "Overdue" but cron endpoint doesn't exist (needs implementation or removal)
2. **Calendar → Journal navigation** - "Open Journal" button not working from calendar date click
3. **Daily Quote** - Need to verify it's actually rotating daily
