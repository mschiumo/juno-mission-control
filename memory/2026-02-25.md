# 2026-02-25 — Early Morning

## PR #156 Status — FEATURE COMPLETE ✅

- ✅ Add edit icon for closed trades
- ✅ Risk ratio validation fix (2.00:1 = valid)
- ✅ P&L calculation fix (calendar matches trade management)
- ✅ Card header layout fixes
- ✅ Delete button on calendar day cells
- ✅ Exit Price column added to trades table
- ✅ Simplified workflow: Add to Calendar → Remove from Closed Positions

## PENDING: Trade Persistence Bug
- **Issue:** Calendar day modal shows summary (+$131.60, 3 trades) but individual trades list is empty
- **Status:** Subagent investigating with debug logging
- **Previous fix:** Timezone fix applied but issue persists
