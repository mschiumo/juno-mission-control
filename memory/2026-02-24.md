## Key Decisions
- Separated all PRs to be single-feature only
- Trello integration doesn't exist in app (nightly task list is hardcoded)
- User wants to disable "Nightly Task Approval" cron
- PR descriptions need proper formatting (not literal \n)

## Outstanding Issues
- Need to verify all PRs build successfully before merging
- Vercel build status should be checked on each PR

- 6 PRs created (#148-#154)
